# 🚀 AI Automation (Work in Progress)

This project is my learning journey to build simple AI automations.
The goal is to create small tools that automate tasks using AI — step by step — without going too technical.

Anyone who wants to learn or contribute is welcome.

## 📌 What This Project Is About

* Understanding how AI automation works
* Building small features one by one
* Keeping important backend logic private
* Creating a simple base that can grow in the future

This is an early-stage project and will improve over time.

## 📁 Project Structure (Simple View)

### 🟦 Public (Safe to Share)

These parts can be open-source:

* **app-frontend/** → basic front-end pages
* **docs/** → guides and notes
* **sdk/** → helper functions

---

### 🔒 Private (NOT Open-Source)

These folders contain important or sensitive logic:

* **core-engine/** → how tasks run
* **connectors/** → connections to apps
* **ai-flows/** → AI prompts and logic
* **billing/** → payments (future)
* **admin/** → internal tools

Separating public and private folders keeps the project safe.
